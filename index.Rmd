Loi CADA (1978) : a large definition of administrative documents, a simple procedure and an ombudsman (CADA). Now a constitutional right.

Butâ€¦

* Awareness of the law is still weak among citizens and civil servants. 

* Requests are often bypassed or not even considered (50% of requests await response).

* FOIA officers and procedures are often not in place in government administrations. They too often await the ombudsman's intervention (_avis CADA_) before releasing documents.
